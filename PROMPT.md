Build a Storage-Agnostic GraphQL Gateway in Python (FastAPI + Pydantic + Supabase + Firebase)

üß† Role & Perspective:
Act as a backend architect building a modular GraphQL API gateway in Python 3.11+, using FastAPI, Strawberry, Pydantic v2, and Poetry.

üéØ Goal:
Develop a GraphQL API that:

Authenticates users via Supabase JWT

Aggregates data from Supabase, Redis, Firebase (Firestore), and future backends

Uses Pydantic models for all data contracts

Implements adapter-based storage architecture with pluggable NoSQL and SQL connectors

Returns GraphQL responses only (REST optional but not required)

üõ† Constraints:
Language: Python 3.11+

Runtime: FastAPI

Package Manager: Poetry

Models: Pydantic v2

Auth: Supabase JWT via middleware

API Format: GraphQL using Strawberry (or Ariadne)

Persistence Layer: Abstracted adapter pattern for:

Supabase (SQL)

Redis (cache)

Firebase/Firestore (NoSQL)

Future DBs like MongoDB, DynamoDB

All adapters must conform to the same interface (AbstractStorageAdapter)

Async throughout

üîÅ Chain of Execution:
Project Bootstrapping

Scaffold via Poetry

Setup FastAPI + Strawberry + Pydantic v2

Install adapters: Supabase, Firestore, Redis

Authentication

Middleware to verify Supabase JWT

Attach user claims to request context

GraphQL Schema

Define all query/mutation types via Strawberry

Types must be backed by Pydantic models

Adapter Layer

Define AbstractStorageAdapter (interface)

Implement:

SupabaseAdapter

RedisAdapter

FirestoreAdapter

Allow runtime selection via config or DI

Models

Define all IO schemas using Pydantic v2

Use .model_validate() and .model_dump() consistently

Resolvers

Authenticate via request context

Query data through selected adapter only

Return GraphQL Pydantic-wrapped response

Testing

Use Pytest

Mock Supabase/Firebase/Redis clients

Add edge case coverage for: timeout, adapter failover, data mismatch

DevOps

Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml

.env config system to pick storage engine

Firebase key file via volume or secret mount

üí° GraphQL Query Example
graphql
Copy
Edit
query {
  user(id: "abc123") {
    id
    fullName
    email
    recentActivity {
      timestamp
      action
    }
  }
}
Edge-Case Coverage
Firebase document not found

Redis cache miss or failure

Supabase downtime

Switching from SQL ‚Üí NoSQL with no code refactor

JWT expired or missing roles

Reusable For:
Cross-service GraphQL API orchestration

Serverless-compatible APIs

Real estate, SaaS, AI dashboards, mobile backends

Firebase + Supabase hybrid stack
